# simple-math-compiler-rs

This repository came out of me doing some research into compilers. 
I stumbled accross [pest](https://pest.rs/) and this was the result of
me learning how to use the libarary. This also stemmed from me wanted to
write some code based on some of the things I learned at uni a while back.
